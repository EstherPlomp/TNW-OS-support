This page contains several frequently asked questions (FAQ) regarding Open Science:

1.  **Is this something that is taken into account when looking for a next job?**

-   Read the publication: '[five selfish reasons to work reproducible](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7)' or watch the presentation.

-   Some of the vacancies have listed open science requirements, see here for an overview: '[Academic job offers that mentioned open science](https://osf.io/7jbnt/)'

-   Funders are asking about this! See for example: [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/open-science)

-   Preprints receive more citations for their eventually published papers! See [Fu and Hughey 2019](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52646); [Fraser et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00043); [Sarabipour et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022079)

-   Papers with open data also receive more citations: [Piwowar et al. 2007](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308); [Piowar and Vision 2014;](http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.175) [Colavizza et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416)

2.  **What does the TU Delft facilitate?**

-   There\'s a [TU Delft Open Science Community](https://osc-delft.github.io/)

-   There\'s a Data Steward at your faculty - Esther ([e.plomp\@tudelft.nl](mailto:e.plomp@tudelft.nl))

-   There\'s a data repository which you can use to share your data/code: [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/)

-   There are some MOOCs and courses you can take,

    -   [Research Data Management 101](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/training-evenementen/training-voor-onderzoekers/research-data-management-101)

    -   [Open Life Science](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme) (for any TNW discipline, not just Life Sciences)

    -   [Software Carpentry](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/software-carpentry-workshop) and [Code Refinery](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/coderefinery-workshops) Workshops (programming workshops)

    -   [TU Delft Open Science MOOC](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/open-science-sharing-your-research-with-the-world/)

3.  **What are the open science regulations from the TU?**

-   PhDs that started from the 1st of Jan 2019 will need to share the code/data underlying their articles/thesis through a data repository and PhDs that started from the 1st of Jan 2020 will have to [set up a Data Management Plan](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/DMP-PhD/).

    -   You can find the TNW policy here: <https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf> 

    -   And the TU Delft policy here: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159> (on Zenodo, another data repository!)

-   Since 2016 it is mandatory for TU Delft researchers to make their work available through direct open access.

    -   See the The TU Delft[ Open Access policy](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/Open.tudelft.nl/OA_beleid.pdf) 

    -   Through ['You Share, We Take Care' project](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/you-share-we-take-care) the publishers version can be shared after a 6 month embargo period

-   There\'s a [TU Delft Resesearch Software Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662). You can make your code available through [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) using one of the licenses that TU Delft approves (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0). 

**4. Who cares about what you put online?**

-   Researchers in your discipline that would like to verify or reuse the work

-   You in six months. In case anyone is asking about your outputs you can always provide them with a link to them, and it won\'t cost you a lot of work at that point because you already have it out there! 

-   TU Delft: Whenever possible, data/code should be made available in a repository (see the [TU Delft Research Data policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159))

-   Journals. Some journals require you to make the code/data/methods available. You should always check the requirements of the journal before you submit. Usually there will be a section in the authors guidelines!

-   Funders. [Funding agencies have requirements.](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-2021/)

5.  **Up to what degree do you want to put data online?**

-   The minimal requirements are the data underlying the publication, so the processed data. If it is useful to share the raw data it is encouraged.

-   Try to share data in a reusable and/or open format. For example, you can share an excel sheet, but not everyone will have access to microsoft products, so it is also helpful to share a .csv file of that excel sheet so that everyone can access it. 

6.  **Where do I put my data/code?**

-   You can archive/publish your data (or code) using a data journal if the dataset is extensive enough. Examples are [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/) and [Data in brief](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief) for data. 

-   You can also publish your code through a publication format using, for example, [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/), [Software Impacts](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/software-impacts/) and the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) (no subscription fees or publishing costs for this one!)

-   If you want to publish data that is underlying a \'regular\' paper you can always use a data repository such as [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). You can also see if you can find a more disciplinary specific repository by using keywords of your research topic through [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/). They have an overview of the data repositories. There may not be a very specific archive that you can use to share your data. In that case 4TU.ResearchData/Zenodo are always good options!

7.  **What do you do when the processed data is actually wrong?**

-   You cannot remove the data once you have published/shared them publicly, but you are able to upload a new version. You can then explain in the README file that there was a mistake in the data and that the current version is the correct version!

-   Correcting and updating your data will increase trust in you as a researcher ([Ebersole et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002460))

Is it better to put unpolished code online or nothing?

-   I would say that it is better to share. Having your code well documented and polished will be more useful, but to at least have access to the working script would be better than to not be able to verify your results at all. It doesnt\' make sense on the other hand to just post some random script on the internet that doesn\'t work etc, so it shouldn\'t become a \'codedump\'. 

How can code be misused?

I\'m not sure; there are probably ways for your code to be misused. You can apply the Apache license to your code that holds a \'Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability\' clausule ([point 9 here](https://ant.apache.org/license.html)) in it that states that the person using/sharing your code with adaptations is taking full responsibility for any liabilities. 

Is it even good to share source code?

    We discussed this during the meeting and I think in general we agreed that it is a good idea. You can accelerate scientific discovery through sharing your code so that others can re-use it, or you can establish collaborations if others are interested in using your code. You can also increase your visibility/impact when others find your code and reuse it.

Licensing

-   How should we be licensing our data and code?

    -   TU Delft recommends CC-BY, but it is up to you how you want to license your data. CC-BY is recommended because it allows for the broadest reuse of your data. With each restriction you place on your dataset (no commercial use or modification), you complicate the reuse of your data. 

        -   See the [Creative Commons Website](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) for an overview of the licenses

        -   Creative Commons are also setting up a [license selector](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)!

    -   For software you can share your code under the Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0 without a problem. Other licenses are also possible, but get in touch with the data steward to discuss it. (this is in the new software policy that is not out yet!). See this website for an overview: <https://choosealicense.com/> 

-   Does the TU have regulations for how our scientific output ought to be licensed?

    -   TU Delft does not for articles, but your funder may have requirements. Especially NWO and the European projects are asked to make their work available Open Access, preferably under a CC-BY license.

-   Might these regulations be at odds with the preferences of us, our supervisors, collaborators, or commercial partners?

    -   Perhaps for the software. In that case it is crucial to check with your collaborators what they want to use etc. If you\'re the main person responsible for a project you could have more of a say in this, but if someone else is a first author their preferences may have more weight. You should check this for each collaboration, just as you discuss the authorship for each publication!

    -   In general all the funding agencies will encourage Open Science, so there is not necessarily a conflict there (this ties back to what Jeroen said during the meeting about public money being spend that should offer something in return to the public that is funding the research!). But in case you\'re working with a commercial partner the story is entirely different. Depending on how much funding they contributed they might hold the rights to the data/code. This should be defined in any contracts you have with these partners, so it would be good to check that with your supervisor. These contracts should of course be respected, so if anyone is asking about the data/code you can always say that you cannot share the data yet due to commercial interests. However, usually when you are at the stage of publication it is still possible to share the data underlying the publication (but again, always check!). 

\

How to store written lab journal entries? Is this part of the data as well?

-   Make sure you have a digital copy somewhere: you can lose your written labbooks (or your house/lab can burn down and you will lose all of this info). You can either scan your written notes and save these as pdf files, or write your notes up digitally. This last option can also allow you to structure this data a bit better so that it is easier for you to come back to it three months later!

Can a .txt file, a written header in a datafile or similar be a replacement of a written labjournal?

-   Sure! You could really just keep a word document of your labjournal, or use other applications such as OneNote or Evernote. You can also take it another step further and use an electronic lab note journal. TU Delft offers licenses for [eLABjournal](https://www.elabjournal.com/) and[ RSpace](https://www.researchspace.com/). Get in touch ([e.plomp\@tudelft.nl](mailto:e.plomp@tudelft.nl)) if you\'re interested!)

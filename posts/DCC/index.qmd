TU Delft has a Digital Competence Center (DCC) which consists of four Research Software Engineers, two Data Managers and a High Performance Computing Data Steward.

The DCC helps you with practically applying the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/) to your research data and code.

The DCC helps any researcher at the TU Delft in the following two ways:

1.  **Under 30 hour requests**

    -   code reviews

    -   repository reviews

    -   quick data questions

    -   tips & consults

2.  **Dedicated part-time support**

    -   a Data Manager or Research Software engineer joins a research group for up to 340 hours during 6 months

    -   dependent on FAIR value add and expertise of DCC members

    -   dedicated application form on DCC (next one likely September 2022)

Support can look like:

-   Find suitable solutions for data storage, access, back-up and automated processing

-   Package, distribute and release research software

-   Set up collaborative data and software development workflows with version control

-   Implement automated software testing for continuous integration

## Previous Applied Sciences projects that received part time support: 

**Towards clinical implementation of fast dose calculation algorithms** (Zoltan Perko and Danny Lathouwers)

-   Making existing solutions ([**OpenGPC**](https://gitlab.com/zperko/opengpc) and [**DoTa**](https://github.com/opaserr/dota)) available to the clinical context

**Interactive Datacube** (Gary Steele)

-   To develop a fast, interactive visualization and analysis tool for multidimensional datasets that are embedded inside a Jupyter Notebook

**OpenDDM (**Iain Muntz and James Conboy)

-   [**OpenDDM**](https://koenderinklab.github.io/OpenDDM/readme.html) is a Python package to analyse an image sequence and measure diffusion properties through Fourier techniques

## Publishing a Data Article

This post has been adapted from the Turing Way (The Turing Way Community, The Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science. [10.5281/zenodo.3233853](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853)) and a [blogpost on Open Working](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2022/02/17/publishing-a-data-article/) under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.

A **Data Article** (also known as a Data Paper/Note/Release, or Database article) is a publication that is focused on the description of a dataset. It uses the traditional journal article structure, but focuses on the data-collection and methodological aspects and generally not on the interpretation or discussion of the results. Data articles are in line with the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/), especially since most publishers will encourage you to share the data through a [data repository](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html#rr-rdm-sharing). The benefit of a Data Article is that your output will be peer reviewed, something which is generally not the case for datasets that are archived on data repositories. It also facilitates recognition for datasets through research assessment procedures that are more traditionally focused on publication output. Publishing a data paper will therefore increase the visibility, credibility and usability of the data, as well as giving you credit as a data producer (The Turing Way Community 2022).

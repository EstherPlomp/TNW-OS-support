## What if I cannot share my data/code?

The following types of data/code [may not be suitable to share](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547667):

-   **Personal data**

    -   Ensure consent has been given to process and share the data

    -   Anonymise or aggregate the data before sharing or use restricted access to share this data. See [The Turing Way for more information on sharing sensitive data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpm/sharing-sensitive-data.html).

-   **Commercially confidential data**

    -   Be careful with sharing this type of data: also data about this data can be compromising to share!

    -   Always store this data securely, preferable on the [Project Drive](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/storage-solutions/#project-drive), with access management in place. This is particularly important if you're working with multiple partners (so that you do not accidentally cross-share information). Make sure you follow any requirements regarding data deletion.

    -   You can check with your supervisor/industry partner what data/code can be shared. This is preferably agreed upon in advance in a data transfer agreement or an agreement (check with your contract manager).

        -   Make sure that in any agreements you sign you are eventually able to use and share the data/code underlying the articles/theses.

    -   You are generally able to share the data underlying the publication, or the data that does not have a confidential component.

    -   You can also share the data under a temporary embargo (so that the IP is protected until patent applications are finalised).

-   **Data belonging to third parties**

    -   You may be collaborating with other researchers that have to follow different requirements

    -   Indicate the third party which the data belongs to, so that potential access requests can be directed to that third party

-   **Other types of confidential data**

    -   National security (nuclear research, military research)

    -   Export control regulations

    -   Certain human or animal research

-   **Data too large to be published online in a repository**

    -   [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) offers each TU Delft researcher the possibility to publish up to 1TB of data free of charge

    -   You may need to make a selection of the data you'll share publicly and indicate clearly how you can be contacted if further access is needed

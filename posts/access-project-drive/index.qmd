This post describes how to access the Project Drive on your computer and how to access it outside of the TU Delft network.

Please see the [Storage Solution post](/posts/storage-solutions-index.qmd) to learn how to request a Project Drive.

## Project Drive location on your computer

The Project Drive is on 'This PC', the same location as your home drive:

U: or \\\\tudelft.net\\staff-umbrella\\ (Windows) or /tudelft.net/staff-umbrella/ (Linux servers) or sftp.tudelft.nl:/staff-umbrella/

You can check the Project Drives that you have access to via webdrive: https://webdata.tudelft.nl/staff-umbrella/

## Access Project Drive outside TU Delft

Sign into [EduVPN](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=c8cdd52059fd4e9a8b7ca402572e3225).

**Windows**

Install [WebDrive](https://webdata.tudelft.nl/) and open it. Click on sftp.tudelft.nl. Click on staff-umbrella (this is the Project Drive).\
External employees/students have to use FileZilla.

**Mac**

You can try to use WebDrive as described for Windows. If this does not work: In the Finder, type âŒ˜K or choose Go \> Connect to Server; enter server address(smb://tudelft.net/staff-umbrella/) and click 'Connect'. (Add the address to your 'Favorite Servers' list to easily connect later)

Alternatively, users can connect via sftp:

\- The terminal: `sftp yournetid@sftp.tudelft.nl` - `cd staff-umbrella`

\- An ftp client such as FileZilla or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/).

**Linux**

If Ubuntu or CentOS installed by ICT:

-   Terminal: `cd /tudelft.nl/staff-umbrella /project`

-   File manager (nautilus or dolphin): Other locations -\> Computer -\> tudelft.net -\> staff-umbrella -\> project

If Linux installed by user:

-   Terminal: `sftp netid@sftp.tudelft.nl` - `cd staff-umbrella/project`

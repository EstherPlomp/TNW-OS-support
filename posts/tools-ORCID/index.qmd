2\. Once you are logged in, select the '**Personal overview**' menu and click '**edit profile**'

3\. In **Edit profile** you can click on '**Create or Connect your ORCID ID**'. There will be a pop-up that explains that you are directed to the [ORCID webpage](https://orcid.org/) where you can log-in to ORCID or create an ORCID ID. Click Proceed.

4\. In ORCID, you can create your ORCID or you can log in if you already have an ORCID. After you are logged in you can give TU Delft -- Pure permission to access your ORCID account by clicking '**Authorize**'.

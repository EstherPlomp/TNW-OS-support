## Open Science

**Open Science** is the movement to make scientific research and its outputs more accessible and transparently available, allowing a wider range of contributions that will increase research quality.

**Open Science** is [defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en) as *"an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community."*

Several concepts belong under the umbrella term of 'Open Science' and these include equity and inclusion, Open Data, Open Software, Open Methods, Open Hardware, Open Review, Open Access, FAIR, Open Education, Community building, Citizen Science.

## Benefits of Open Science

-   Increased impact and visibility: Research will be accessible to anyone and it is easier to build on previous work

-   Maximise research effort by making research and [educational](https://universiteitenvannederland.nl/nl_NL/nieuwsbericht/nieuwsbericht/831-p-hogescholen-universiteiten-en-surf-gaan-em-samenwerken-em-aan-digitale-en-open-leermaterialen-p.html) outputs reusable

-   Improving the quality of research through more transparency (facilitating reproducibility) which will [increase trust](https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625221100686) in research

-   Increased citizen engagement with and participation in research

-   Accelerates discovery and provides opportunity for collaborations

-   Recognition for all contributions to research

-   Take back control over research outputs by maintaining your rights

The Dutch position paper '[Room for everyone's talent](https://www.nwo.nl/sites/nwo/files/media-files/2019-Recognition-Rewards-Position-Paper_EN.pdf)' aims to recognise a wider range of academic contributions, which is very much in line with Open Science practices.

## TU Delft

TU Delft has a long history of engagement with Open Science and it is TU Delft's ambition to be a frontrunner, as reflected in its [Open Science Programme 2020-2024, Research and Education in the Open Era](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/tu-delft-open-science/about-the-programme) and the TU Delft Strategic Framework 2018-2024, with "openness" as one of its major principles. TU Delft also strives to be a great place to work, as outlined in the core values: Diversity, Integrity, Respect, Engagement, Courage and Trust (DIRECT) and the [Code of Conduct](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Integriteitsbeleid/COC%20EN.pdf). TU Delft established several policies and framework that fall under the Open Science umbrella:

• TU Delft Policy on [Open Access Publishing](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/OA_beleid_def_29-1-2016.pdf) (2016)

• TU Delft [Research Data Policy Framework](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/researchdata-framework-policy.pdf) (2019, 2021)

• TU Delft [Research Software Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662) (2021)

• TU Delft [Diversity & Inclusion Office](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/strategy-documents-tu-delft/diversity-policy) (2021)

• TU Delft [Vision on Integrity](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Integriteitsbeleid/TU%20Delft%20Vision%20on%20Integrity%202018-2024.pdf) 2018-2024

• TU Delft [Recognition & Rewards Perspective](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Erkennen%20en%20Waarderen%20-%20recognition%20and%20reward/TU%20Delft%20Recognition%20and%20Rewards%20perspective%20def.pdf) 2021 -- 2024

• TU Delft [Policy on Open Educational Resources](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:68a07efc-fc4d-4a57-8e93-88a3af37465a) (2021)

## the Netherlands

-   In the Netherlands Open Science is an important component of the [Recognition & Rewards](https://recognitionrewards.nl/) movement.

-   Dutch research funder [NWO supports](https://www.nwo.nl/en/open-science) new forms of evaluation, requires 100% Open Access and sharing of data/code underlying research articles.

-   The ['Strategic Evaluation Protocol'](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf) that universities use to periodically evaluate their research has a strong focus Open Science practices and outputs.

## Internationally

-   The [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/) (to which all Dutch universities adhere to).

-   The ['Reforming research assessment'](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/reforming-research-assessment-agreement-now-final-2022-07-20_en) agreement by the European Union. Open Science has for years been promoted by the European Commission.

-   UNESCO adopted a [recommendation](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) on Open Science.

-   The [White House also committed](https://cen.acs.org/policy/publishing/White-House-mandates-immediate-open/100/web/2022/08#:~:text=All%20US%20federally%2Dfunded%20research,31%2C%202025.) the United States to Open Science, which pushes for Open Access, and FAIR data and code sharing.

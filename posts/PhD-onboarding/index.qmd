[Research Data Management 101](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/r4.a1-research-data-management-101) (Faculty version in March! Please [fill out the form](https://forms.office.com/r/PLm9TMBGGk) if you're interested)

[Open Life Science program](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/open-life-science-programme)

The Open Life Science program is a 16 week training that you can follow for 16 weeks to learn all about applying Open Science practices to your own research project. Next round will probably start in February 2023, with the application deadline in January 2023 (to describe your project and your learning objectives).

## Data Management plan

Any PhD starting after 1st of Jan 2020:

-   **Write a Data Management Plan: as part of the Go/No-Go meeting** in your first year.

-   In the **PhD agreement** you'll have to describe how you'll do this

You can fill out a plan using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) (see [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/plan/dmponline/dmponline/) for a short explanation)

In your Data Management Plan you will focus on questions related to Data Management:

-   Where do you store your data?

-   How will you share your data from your publications?

Your supervisor will have to approve your plan.

More detailed information on [this website](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/DMP-PhD/).

You can also read up on the policies here: [TU Delft Research Data Framework](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies/), [Faculty Policy (pdf)](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf).

## Sharing the data/code underlying your articles/thesis

Before your defense you should share your research outputs (data/code underlying the articles/thesis).

The data management plan allows you to already think about how you will do this!

## Do's and Don'ts 

**Do's:**

-   Set up a Data Management plan

-   Ask questions

-   Follow workshops/courses (for credits!)

-   Discuss data/code/open science with your supervisor

-   [Join the Open Science Community](https://forms.gle/v2dtynQ2j6wSMWTS6)

**Don'ts:**

-   Keep everything closed (unless you have restrictions)

-   Share without discussing this with your supervisor/collaborators

-   Figure everything out yourself

[CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) is a taxonomy of 14 roles. You can use CRediT to describe each contributor's specific contribution to the scholarly output.

CrediT contributes to a more transparent research record.

A helpful tool to record CredIT contributions is [Tenzing](https://rollercoaster.shinyapps.io/tenzing/). You can cite [Holcombe et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244611) when you use this tool.

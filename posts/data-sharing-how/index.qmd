How to share data?

## Data not available upon request

-   Only 26-40% of psychologists and social scientists complied with a request to access the data ([Tedersoo et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00981-0); [Wicherts et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.726)).

-   Only 44% of economists provided their data and materials upon request ([Krawczyk & Reuben 2012](https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2012.678688)).

-   14% one

To share the research data in accordance with the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/), you need to select a data repository.

When selecting a repository, researchers should consider the following:

-   Where are similar datasets preserved?

-   How long will the data be kept?

-   Who manages the repository? An institution? A commercial provider?

-   What are the costs or file size requirements associated with using the repository? How will those costs be paid? Are the file size requirements sufficient for your research project?

-   What are the access and use policies for the repository? Are you able to select a license?

## Discipline specific repository

Ideally, your discipline has a data repository available that you can use. There are several benefits of using such a discipline specific repository:

-   They use relevant metadata and specific requirements when you upload the data

-   They facilitate aggregated datasets as the shared datasets are structured alike

-   Access in community used formats

-   Data is more findable, since similar types of data are available in the same repository

-   Generally, there is some type of quality assurance during the upload process as the repository is more closely managed by experts in the field

## General repository

Realistically, not every discipline has such a specific data repository available. In this case, you can always make use of more generalist repositories, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info//en/). These repositories have less strict requirements when uploading the data and accept a wide range of formats.

## Linking research outputs

Whether you use a discipline specific repository or a generalist one, it is important to link all the outputs to ensure that they are clearly identifiable and findable. You can do this by providing links/persistent identifiers in the metadata fields, or in the README file, or in the data availability statement in the corresponding article. See The Turing Way for more information about how to [link your research outputs](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html).

## Use standard or open file formats

Using standard or open data formats ensures longer-term usability of data.

-   **Standard Data Formats**: "widely accepted" formats such as .xls .xlsx

-   **Open Data Formats**: Free to use such as .csv .tab

## Preferred (sustainable) file formats:

The following file formats are [recommended by 4TU.ResearchData](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/preffered_file_formats.pdf).

-   **Text Plain** text, XML, HTML, PDF (PDF/A-1), JSON, PDB (Protein Data Bank), XYZ (all formats should be encoded in UTF-8)

-   **Spreadsheets** CSV (Comma-separated values), Tab-delimited values, PDF (PDF/A-1)

-   **Images** JPEG, TIFF, PNG, SVG

-   **Geospatial** GML (Geographical Mark-up Language), KML (Keyhole Mark-up Language), ESRI Shapefile, Geo-referenced TIFF

-   **Numerical** NetCDF, CSV, JSON

-   **Video** No sustainable format established

-   **Audio** Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE)

-   **Databases** Delimited Flat File w/DDL

-   **Archives** ZIP, TAR, GZIP, 7Z

## Are you working with personal/confidential data?

Personal/confidential data can contain:

-   personal information which can allow the identification of living individuals (have you set up an [HREC application](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics)?)

-   commercially-confidential information (e.g. something you might want to patent, or data belonging to a third party)

-   Information related to national security , export control regulations etc.

## 5. Is there a clear strategy for data sharing?

TU Delft [Research Data Framework Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159) requires all PhD students who started on or after 1 January 2019 to deposit research data (and code) supporting their theses before they can graduate .

-   Did the project team agree what data (and code), when and how will be shared? (See [what data should be shared post](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-what/))

-   Will there be any difficulties with data sharing (perhaps not all data is suitable for sharing)?

-   What [licence](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/) will be the most suitable for the data (and code)?

In principle, for most research done at TU Delft, it is suitable to make the data and code underpinning research findings available in a data repository. Typically, this is done at the same time as publishing the related papers, theses or reports. TU Delft has a dedicated data repository, [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), where all TU Delft researchers can deposit up to 1TB of data per year (per researcher) free of charge. Discipline specific repositories might also be suitable (the Data Steward can advise).

A registered report is an article format where the study proposal is peer-reviewed before the research is undertaken.

After approved by the reviewers, the results will be published as long as the study proposal is followed and deviations are clearly indicated. This article format facilitates the publication of negative results and reduces time wasted on irrelevant study proposals.

There are 2 main options: submit to a single journal that offers Registered Reports or to the supra-journal platform [Peer Community In Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/) (PCI RR). For the former option, refer to the [current list of journals that offer Registered Reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports).

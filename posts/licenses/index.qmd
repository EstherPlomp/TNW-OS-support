Licenses are a standardised way to share data/code and let anyone know what it is that they are allowed to do with it. If you share your research without a license, you are not making clear how you wish the research to be used which might prevent it being used the way you intend.

## Data Licenses

Everything in the list with a CC in front of it is used for data (stands for [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)).

TU Delft recommends **CC-BY** (which is also quite standard in publishing articles)and allows reusers to cite the original work if they reuse it.

The more letters these CC licenses have, the more restrictions they place on re-use.

-   NC means non-commercial use is prohibited

-   SA stands for share alike, which means that you have to apply the same license.

-   ND means non-derivative, which means that reusers can only reuse the data in the same form (which is quite restrictive!).

## Software

For software there are different licenses because you can execute software (which makes it a bit more complex). CC-BY and MIT/BSD work quite similar in that they only require citation. GPL is a copyleft license that requires any software that it touches to be shared under the same license which requires open sharing (so this might hamper industry collaboration). I hope this makes a bit more sense? I'm happy to try and clarify this further!

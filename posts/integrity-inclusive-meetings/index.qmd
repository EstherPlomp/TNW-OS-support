From the [guide to organizing Inclusive Scientific Meetings: Where to Start](https://500womenscientists.org/inclusive-scientific-meetings)

-   Check implicit biases

-   Whoever talks has the power

-   Participation is not only about who is in the space, but also how they're doing in the space

-   Designing for universal access benefits everyone

-   Make your diversity, equity, inclusion, justice and accessibility work transparent and share the workload equitably

-   Demonstrating progress requires data

-   Set and enforce clear expectations for appropriate behaviour and structures of accountability (for example, a code of conduct)

-   Seek funding that reflects your values around equity and inclusion

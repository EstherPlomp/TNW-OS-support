This post is a shortened version of the [Agile Reproducibility Checklist](https://osf.io/phmce/) for articles that you would like to submit (or review).

## For all datasets included/produced in the paper, check if data:

-   Is provided in a non-proprietary format

-   Is documented for third parties to reuse

-   Is accessible in a public repository and has an open data [licence](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/)

## For all software tools/libraries/packages and computational workflows included/produced, check if:

-   Reproduction steps are explained in a README (plain text file), flowchart, or script

-   Computational environments (including hardware) are documented or provided

-   Versions of relevant software components (libraries, packages) are provided

-   All parameters and expected execution times for the computational workflow are provided

-   Software developed by the authors is available in a public repository and has an open licence

-   There is a clear connection between tables, figures, maps, and statistical values and the data and code that they are based on, e.g., using file names or documentation in the README

## In the Data and Software Availability section:

-   Include data/software availability statements (see [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cite.html?#data-availability-statement-examples) for examples)

-   Include the reasons, if any, for not being able to share (parts of) data or code

## For all data and software:

-   All datasets and code (used or mentioned) are assigned DOIs

-   Datasets and code are cited throughout the paper

Quantum computing's reproducibility crisis: Majorana fermions.

' ... I think that researchers are cherry-picking --- focusing on data that agree with the Majorana theory and sidelining those that don't.' [Frolov 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00954-8)

"Scientists should disclose all data in a repository and comply with sharing standards, such as FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability). Some curation is unavoidable. The volume of data collected in a modern physics laboratory is high: computer scripts control the equipment, which might run 24 hours a day. A remedy is to clearly explain the protocol that is used to perform any data selection --- so others might reuse or scrutinize it. Remember, data selection is a form of data processing." [Frolov 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00954-8)

## TU Delft

[The investigation by experts concluded](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/retraction-nature-article-quantized-majorana-conductance):

-   **Authors selected data** that supported the phenomenon they were looking for

-   **Authors omitted data** that could have raised questions about the conclusions

"It is a good thing that independent experts have looked at this as part of the integrity investigation," says Tim van der Hagen, Rector Magnificus of TU Delft. "Science always involves **looking critically at results**, questioning and challenging them."

TU Delft Library provides the Research Data Management 101 (RDM101) course via the Central Graduate School.

You can sign up via their waiting/notification list via the [Trainingportal](https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us/). Go to '**Research -- Research Data Management**' category, and then you can select the '**Research Data Management 101**' course. Then you should be able to see a red button saying '**notification list**'. See the screenshot below:

## Faculty/TNW version of the course

Due to the long waiting list for this course, there has also been a Faculty organised version of the course since 2023. The sign up list is currently closed, but you can always email Esther to be added to the waiting list, or to receive more information about the course.

**Main differences between the central GS and AS Faculty version of the course**

-   The faculty version will have two mandatory in-person sessions instead of three

-   The AS Faculty version will take 4-5 weeks instead of 3, covering the same content

-   For the self-paced parts we will not use Brightspace, but a website/GitHub (<https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/>)

-   The main materials, assignments and Graduate School Credits you'll receive are identical (1.5 credits for **Research Skills**)

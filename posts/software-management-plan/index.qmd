## Software Management Plan

The Netherlands eScience Center and NWO set up guidance for Software Management Plans in the [Practical guide to Software Management Plans](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7038280) (pages 22-28). The questions you'll have to address in your plan will depend on the size and impact of the software you're setting up the plan for.

There are currently no templates available for this in DMPonline.

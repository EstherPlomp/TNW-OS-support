6\. A window should open on 4TU.ResearchData that shows your GitHub/GitLab account. When you click on your connected account you will see the repositories which you can import (alternatively you can do this by going to upload and then click the GitHub/GitLab icon to import repositories).

7\. Select the tick box in front of the repository/repositories that you want to import and select '**Import selected repos**'.

-   If your repository has multiple releases, you can select which release you want to import

-   If your repository has no releases yet, the latest commit will be imported.

8\. If you turn the sync on by clicking on '**OFF**', your upload will automatically generate a new version for every [release]{.underline} of your repository. You can switch this sync back off.

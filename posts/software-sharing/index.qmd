## Why share your software/code?

-   Accelerates innovation as it is easier to receive feedback that you can learn from and use to improve the software

-   Provide evidence for your scientific claims and increases the reproducibility of your work

-   [Increases impact](https://openforumeurope.org/open-source-impact-study/) and visibility of your research ([software can also be cited](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/software-citation/)!)

-   Facilitates collaboration

-   Improves sustainability as you're not the only one who can maintain the software and contributions can be made by community members

-   Open Source Software is encouraged by the [UNESCO recommendations](https://www.unesco.org/en/communication-information/open-solutions)

-   Your funder may require you to share the underlying software/code of your publications

-   Your software may be checked during peer review (see [Nature Human Behaviour](https://www-nature-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/articles/s41562-021-01190-w))

-   Your work is probably relying on open source software to a certain degree, so it would be good to contribute back to the community!

## TU Delft and Open Software

TU Delft encourages sharing of your software/code and the [TU Delft Research Software Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662) preapproves the following licenses: MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, EUPL, CC0 when you share your software.

When sharing your software you should also share a version of the software using a data repository. You can either use [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/) or another repository to share your software/code:

### 4TU.ResearchData

-   Log in right top using TU Delft credentials

-   Select 'Add a New Dataset':

    -   ![](images/image-1485752732.png)

-   Add relevant metadata in the information fields

-   Under the header 'Files' you can find the instructions to publish directly from a Git repository under 'Software deposit':

### Other repositories

-   Upload your software in another repository (for example: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).

-   Go to <https://pure.tudelft.nl/admin/> and log in using TU Delft credentials

-   Select Datasets/Software -\> Software

-   Fill out the metadata in the information fields and add DOI, select license and save the information

### Copyright

Ideally you also add a copyright transfer to the shared software (see [slide 14 in this presentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4772235)), for example:

*Technische Universiteit Delft hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program "Name program" (one line description of the content or function) written by the Author(s).*

You can then add a copyright notice to assert your own rights:

*Â© YEAR, \[NAME\], \[REFERENCE project, grant or study if desired\]*

You can only add copyright transfer to software that you **share under an open source software license**.

## Feedback

Before sharing your code/software in a data repository it can be helpful to ask a colleague or collaborator to review it.

## Critical elements for usable software ([Doherty et al. 2023](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2023-06-22-sorry-state-usable-software-open-science-results-open-science-retreat))

-   **License**

-   **Documentation:** Usage examples are an integral part of the documentation that is often ignored, but can make a significant difference for the user. Well-structured documentation such as (https://documentation.divio.com/) is essential for software to be usable.

-   **Versioning**: If there are multiple releases of code, it should be bundled in releases and accompanied by changelog and release notes.

-   **Deployability**: There needs to be an installation routine available that takes care of compilation and dependency resolution in an automated fashion (see also [executable containers](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers.html) so that users can start immediately).

-   **Avoiding proprietary code base**: software that depends on licensed code bases creates severe barriers to portability and adoption.

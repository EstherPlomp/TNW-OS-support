## Why share your software/code?

-   Accelerates innovation as it is easier to receive feedback that you can learn from and use to improve the software

-   Provide evidence for your scientific claims and increases the reproducibility of your work

-   [Increases impact](https://openforumeurope.org/open-source-impact-study/) and visibility of your research ([software can also be cited](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/software-citation/)!)

-   Facilitates collaboration

-   Improves sustainability as you're not the only one who can maintain the software and contributions can be made by community members

-   Open Source Software is encouraged by the [UNESCO recommendations](https://www.unesco.org/en/communication-information/open-solutions)

-   Your funder may require you to share the underlying software/code of your publications

-   Your work is probably relying on open source software to a certain degree, so it would be good to contribute back to the community!

## TU Delft and Open Software

You can either use 4TU.ResearchData or another repository to share your software/code

### 4TU.ResearchData

-   Log in right top using TU Delft credentials

-   Create a new item or import from GitHub/GitLab

-   Add relevant metadata in the information fields

### Other repositories

-   Upload your software in another repository (for example: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)).

When do you need to set up a Data Management Plan as a PhD candidate at TU Delft/TNW?

## PhD agreement

During the first three months of the doctoral programme, doctoral candidates need to formulate a PhD agreement in consultation with their supervisors. The Data Management plan is part of the other arrangements, but at this point **you do not need a complete plan**! **A complete Data Management Plan is required for the Go/No-Go**. For the PhD agreement it is sufficient to state how you will set up your Data Management Plan. You can briefly state in the form that:

1.  You will follow a course. (As part of the [Research Data Management 101 course](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) you need to set up a Data Management Plan. If you're interested in an Applied Science version of the course, [please fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/r/PLm9TMBGGk)).
2.  You will follow the Data Management Plan that your project/supervisors have already set up.
3.  You will set up the plan yourself using the online platform [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/).
4.  You will set up an appointment with the Data Steward to set up the plan.

You can combine some of these options, for example: follow the Data Management Plan of your supervisor/larger research project and adjust this yourself using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/).

## Data Management Plan

The easiest way to set up your Data Management Plan is to first check whether your supervisor/project already has a Data Management Plan that you can built upon.

If there is no Data Management Plan available yet it is easiest to use the online platform [DMPonline.](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) Here you can make use of the TU Delft template that provides guidance and example answers. You can watch a [recording of Esther](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/QOxmyWwoanBr5Cl) going over filling out the TU Delft template, or go over the questions yourself on the platform:

-   To get started you set up an account on [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/)

-   To select the TU Delft template you select the 'Create plans' header:

-   You can fill out the name of your project in the question "What research project are you planning?" and keep TU Delft as your institution. If you select the "no funder" tick-box you'll get the option to select the TU Delft template.

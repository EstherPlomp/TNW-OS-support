Encryption provides protection by ensuring that only someone with the relevant encryption key (or password) will be able to access the contents.

-   **Disk level**: *Bitlocker* for Windows, *FileVault* for MacOS
-   **"container" level** (a folder containing multiple files): *Veracrypt* for Windows, *Archive* for MacOS (see also Disk Utilities, [more information](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/how-to-use-apples-built-in-features-to-encrypt-files-and-folders))
-   **Portable storage**: *Bitlocker*
-   **File level / Exchange information**
    -   *MS Office encryption* from Office 2016 onward uses AES-256 and is considered secure.

        -   Alternative for multiple files: *7zip* (AES-256 encryption), and pack with a password

        -   More complicated to setup: *PGP tooling* (can also be used to securely send email)
-   For very sensitive data you can use *LANCrypt* (which only works on campus and you will need support from IT).

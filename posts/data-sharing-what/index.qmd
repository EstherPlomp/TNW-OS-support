In order to determine what data should be openly shared ask yourself the following questions:

**What information would another colleague need** to understand

-   what you did,

-   how you did it and

-   how the data can be reused?

**Which data can be shared?**

-   Data restrictions can apply depending on the type of data (personal) or by contractual agreements with third partners.

**When can it be shared?**

Generally it is easiest to share data at the same time as the publication/article. This way you can still correct errors if there are any, and you're still familiar with the data organisation.

## TU Delft [Research Data Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159)

Ensuring that research data, code and any other **materials needed to reproduce research findings** are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a research data repository ... unless there are [valid reasons](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547667) not to do so.

## Faculty of Applied Sciences [Research Data Management Policy](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf)

The minimal requirement is the **deposition of the numerical data (processed data) underlying the figures in academic papers and PhD theses**. Deposition of datasets not directly linked with publications or raw data/software and processing scripts used to derive the processed data is encouraged.

Using standard or open data formats ensures longer-term usability of data

-   **Standard Data Formats**: "widely accepted" formats such as .xls .xlsx

-   **Open Data Formats**: Free to use such as .csv .tab

Convert files into standard open formats for long term preservation of the data

## Preferred (sustainable) file formats: 

Text Plain text, XML, HTML, PDF (PDF/A-1), JSON, PDB (Protein Data Bank), XYZ (all formats should be encoded in UTF-8)

Spreadsheets CSV (Comma-separated values), Tab-delimited values, PDF (PDF/A-1)

Images JPEG, TIFF, PNG, SVG

Geospatial GML (Geographical Mark-up Language), KML (Keyhole Mark-up Language), ESRI Shapefile, Geo-referenced TIFF

**Numerical** NetCDF, CSV, JSON

**Video** No sustainable format established

**Audio** Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE)

**Databases** Delimited Flat File w/DDL

**Archives** ZIP, TAR, GZIP, 7Z

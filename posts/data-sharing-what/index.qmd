In order to determine what data should be openly shared ask yourself the following questions:

**What information would another colleague need** to understand

-   what you did,

-   how you did it and

-   how the data can be reused?

**Which data can be shared?**

-   Data restrictions can apply depending on the type of data ([personal data](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/05-Essentials-for-Research-Data.html#personal-data)) or by contractual agreements with third partners ([confidential data](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/05-Essentials-for-Research-Data.html#confidential-data)).

**When can it be shared?**

Generally it is easiest to share data at the same time as the publication/article. This way you can still correct errors if there are any, and you're still familiar with the data organisation.

## TU Delft [Research Data Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159)

Ensuring that research data, code and any other **materials needed to reproduce research findings** are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a research data repository ... unless there are [valid reasons](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547667) not to do so.

## Faculty of Applied Sciences [Research Data Management Policy](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf)

The minimal requirement is the **deposition of the numerical data (processed data) underlying the figures in academic papers and PhD theses**. Deposition of datasets not directly linked with publications or raw data/software and processing scripts used to derive the processed data is encouraged.

Software citation is important to receive credit for software outputs and to ensure permanent references to the software.

While platforms such as GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket are great for reuse and collaboration, they are no long-term solutions for software preservation. Instead, a snapshot of the software should be shared using a data repository. This data repository will provide you with a persistent identifier, or DOI, which is key for making the code citable.

Some data repositories, such as Zenodo and 4TU.ResearchData, have integrations with GitHub so that you can easily share a release of your software repositories.

-   [Zenodo & GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)

-   [Figshare & GitHub](https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-connect-figshare-with-your-github-account)

Once you shared your software on a data repository and received a DOI, it is important to let others know how they should cite your data. If you're reusing software of others, you should also properly cite their work.

## CFFinit

There is a tool that helps you create a CITATION.cff for your software: [**CFFinit**](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript)**.** Watch the tutorials to learn [how to create a CITATION.cff file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcgLIT5Qd4M), or [how to update it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ik1onYbO3A).

## Software citation: how to format?

The recommended format ([Katz et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26932.1)) for software citation is to include:

**• Creator(s):** the authors or project that developed the software.

• **Title:** the name of the software.

• **Publication venue:** the publication venue of the software, preferentially, an archive or repository that provides persistent identifiers.

• **Date**: the date the software was published.

• **Identifier:** a resolvable pointer to the software, preferentially, a PID that resolves to a landing page containing descriptive metadata about the software, similar to how a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for a paper that points to a page about the paper rather than directly to a representation of the paper, such as the PDF.

• **Version**: the identifier for the version of the software being referenced. If the version is unidentified or unknown, the date of access should be used.

• **Type**: some citation styles (e.g., APA), require a bracketed description of the citation (e.g., \[Computer software\]) to be included.

If a published article exists that describes the software, it should be cited as an additional reference.

::: callout-note
**Example (APA):** Developer, A. A., Developer, B. B., & Developer, C. C. (yyyy) 1. Title of the software: Subtitle (Version #.#) 2. \[Computer software\] 3. Publisher 4. <https://URL5>

See [Katz et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26932.1)) for more examples.

## Software Citation Checklist for Authors [by Neil Chue Hong et al.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3479199).

-   Have I identified the software which makes a significant and specialised contribution to my academic work?

-   Have I checked if the software has a recommended citation?

    -   If this is to a paper, have I also cited the software directly?

    -   If there's no recommended citation, have I created as complete a citation as possible?

        -   Who created the software

        -   When it was created

        -   Title of the software (and version if available)

        -   Where the software can be accessed

-   Have I referenced the software appropriately in my academic work, complying with any citation formatting guidelines?

## Software Citation Checklist for Developers [by Neil Chue Hong et al.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3482769)

-   Have I assigned an appropriate [**license**](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/) to my software?

-   Have I **described my software properly**, using an appropriate metadata format, and included this metadata file with my software?

    -   Have I given my software a clear **version number**?

    -   Have I determined the **authors to be credited** for this release of my software, and included this in my metadata file?

-   Have I procured a **persistent identifier** for this release of my software?

-   Have I added my **recommended citation** to the documentation for my software?

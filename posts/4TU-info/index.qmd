This post contains general information about the data repository [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) and how to share your research data/code.

4TU.ResearchData is the archive of the 4TU.ResearchData Consortium (Delft/Wageningen/Eindhoven/Twente)

-   Free up to 1TB/TU Delft researcher/year

-   Publication and long-term preservation of research data/code

-   Open access (with embargo and restricted access if necessary)

-   DOI (Digital Object Identifier) (allows citation - see [data citation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-citation/index.html) or [software citation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/software-citation/index.html) for more information)

## How to share the data/code?

1.  Gather and organise the research data and/or code. Describe the outputs in your [README file](https://data.4tu.nl/info//fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Guidelines_for_creating_a_README_file.pdf).

    -   Use a consistent folder directory and [file naming convention](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-documentation/#file-naming-convention) for your files

    -   It can be helpful to have a collaborator go over your data/code to see if everything makes sense and check whether they can deploy your software following your documentation, including dependencies information (operating systems, programming languages; interpreters and compilers; packages, libraries, frameworks, or other tools; browsers; databases; web or other online services and resources; file formats, standards and specifications - see [Jackson 2018](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327310)a for more information)

    -   README file: include your contact information (name, affiliation, current email address and your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/)!) as well as how you would like the output to be cited (the output itself or the associated article). For software you can also use a [CITATION.cff file](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cff.html) to recommend citation.

2.  Go to [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), select upload data and login with your netID.

3.  Select '+create a new item'

4.  Fill out the metadata information fields

    -   Some of the fields are mandatory and should be filled out before you can **reserve a DOI**. You need this DOI for in your data availability statement and your reference list (see ...). You can generate a private link for peer review. To learn more about whether to disclose the data/code before the article or the other way around - please see [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html).

    -   In the metadata information fields you can select a [license](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/)

    -   Add any related references (GitHub/Lab repository, article etc).

5.  Upload the data or code and the README file

    1.  You can either upload directories separately or decide to use an archive file (open formats are: .zip .tar, .tgz, or tar.bz2 - See [Jackson 2018](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327327)b)

## Metadata record only

You can use this option if data/code cannot be archived in a repository but you would like to make the data available according to the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/index.html). Explain what additional datasets/materials exist and why access is restricted. Explain who could gain access to the data and under what circumstances.

## Checklist to sharing your research ([Karoune & Plomp 2022](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6615276))

1.  Have you set up a [Data Management Plan](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp.html)? In this Data Management Plan you can think about how you will store, document and share your research.

2.  Ask feedback on how you documented and structured your data and code from someone that is not a co-author: are they able to trace your steps?

3.  Decide in what order you want to publish your research objects: do you want to publicly share the data and code before the article is published or would you rather wait? - see The Turing Way (The Turing Way Community 2022e) for more information on [how to link your research objects](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html) during the sharing process.

4.  Make sure a README file is included with your data/code: even if there is an associated article it is important to provide all relevant information to interpret the data or use the code in the same place as the data/code. You can also [let others know how to cite you in this README file](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3482769).

5.  Ensure that you selected a [license](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/) for your data and code: without it your research objects cannot be reused by others.

6.  Provide the DOI of your research objects where it is relevant (for example, table/figure descriptions, materials and methods section, data/code availability statement).

7.  Check whether you cited your data and code in the references: this is where citations are counted from - not the acknowledgements or data availability statements. If you [reused any data/software you should also cite these](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3479199).

This post contains general information about the data repository [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/).

4TU.ResearchData is the archive of the 4TU.ResearchData Consortium (Delft/Wageningen/Eindhoven/Twente)

-   Free up to 1TB/TU Delft researcher/year

-   Publication and long-term preservation of research data/code

-   Open access (with embargo and restricted access if necessary)

-   DOI (Digital Object Identifier) (allows citation - see [data citation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-citation/index.html) or [software citation](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/software-citation/index.html) for more information)

## How to share the data/code?

1.  Gather and organise the research data and/or code. Describe the outputs in your [README file](https://data.4tu.nl/info//fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Guidelines_for_creating_a_README_file.pdf).

    -   It can be helpful to have a collaborator go over your data/code to see if everything makes sense and check whether they can deploy your software following your documentation, including dependencies information (operating systems, programming languages; interpreters and compilers; packages, libraries, frameworks, or other tools; browsers; databases; web or other online services and resources; file formats, standards and specifications - see [Jackson 2018](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327310)a for more information)

    -   README file: include your contact information (name, affiliation, current email address and your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/)!) as well as how you would like the output to be cited (the output itself or the associated article). For software you can also use a [CITATION.cff file](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cff.html) to recommend citation.

2.  Go to [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), select upload data and login with your netID.

3.  Select '+create a new item'

4.  Fill out the metadata information fields

    -   Some of the fields are mandatory and should be filled out before you can **reserve a DOI**. You need this DOI for in your data availability statement and your reference list (see ...). You can generate a private link for peer review. To learn more about whether to disclose the data/code before the article or the other way around - please see [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html).

    -   In the metadata information fields you can select a [license](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/)

    -   Add any related references (GitHub/Lab repository, article etc).

5.  Upload the data or code and the README file

    1.  You can either upload directories separately or decide to use an archive file (open formats are: .zip .tar, .tgz, or tar.bz2 - See [Jackson 2018](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327327)b)

## Metadata record only

You can use this option if data/code cannot be archived in a repository but you would like to make the data available according to the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/index.html). Explain what additional datasets/materials exist and why access is restricted. Explain who could gain access to the data and under what circumstances.

## Why share data?

-   Prevent data loss/unfindable files

-   Can you still use data when people leave?

-   Recognition for all research outputs

-   Increased citations ([Colavizza et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416); [Christensen et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225883); [Piwowar et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308); [Piwowar and Vision 2013](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.175))

-   Collaboration

-   Increases quality of scientific practice by increasing reproducibility and transparency of research

-   Cost/time efficient

-   Prevents retractions

-   Reduces duplication efforts

-   Provides resources for training and education

-   Meeting institutional/funder/industrial requirements

The Coronavirus crisis is one of several global challenges which has highlighted the critical importance of making research data rapidly available for re-use, as well as curated to common standards [(UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/covid19/communicationinformationresponse/opensolutions)).

## Example: Majorana retraction

The authors of the 2018 article Quantized Majorana conductance have retracted this article. The authors were alerted to problems by two scientists in the same research area and then went on to re-examine their earlier measurements. In doing so, they found that the main conclusion had not been adequately substantiated.

Summary of the investigation by experts:

-   Authors **selected data that supported the phenomenon** they were looking for

-   Authors **omitted data** that could have raised questions about the conclusions

"*It is a good thing that independent experts have looked at this as part of the integrity investigation," says Tim van der Hagen, Rector Magnificus of TU Delft. "Science always involves looking critically at results, questioning and challenging them*." [source](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tu-delft/retraction-nature-article-quantized-majorana-conductance)

## Reproducibility concerns

-   [Does Chemical Engineering Research Have a Reproducibility Problem?](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060718-030323)

-   [How Reproducible Are Isotherm Measurements in Metalâˆ’Organic Frameworks?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b04287)

-   [Does repeat synthesis in materials chemistry obey a power law?](https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1918484117)

-   [1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a)

[![](images/paste-28AC93DB.png){fig-alt="Among the factors that contribute to irreproducible research are the lack of methods, code and data being available for the publications."}](https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a)

## Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly

Florian Markowetz provides five selfish reasons in his [article](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7) and [presentation](https://youtu.be/1Y_oIjlH-yg?t=355) (50 min) to work more reproducible. Reproducibility:

1.  helps to avoid disaster
2.  makes it easier to write papers
3.  helps reviewers see it your way
4.  enables continuity of your work
5.  helps to build your reputation

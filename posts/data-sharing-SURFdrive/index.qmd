Through '**Users and Groups**' you can directly share your files with colleagues that are based at Dutch institutes by typing in their names or email addresses.

You can also generate '**Public Links**' by selecting '**create new**' and '**create**'. Don't forget to set a password for the link and an expiration date if needed. Once you have created this link you can copy it through right clicking the file: SURFdrive \> Copy public link to clipboard.

*Note that your SURFdrive application has to be running in the background to be able to generate and copy these links.*

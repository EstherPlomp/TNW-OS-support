Overview of available data sharing solutions **after the project**. These solutions are publicly accessible and not suitable for any confidential data/code.

## General repositories

### [4TU.ResearchData](http://researchdata.4tu.nl/home/)

-   Archiving of finalized datasets (open accessible, unless you specify an embargo period up to two years)

-   Obtain a DOI for your dataset and [link it with your publication](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-linking.html)

-   Free up to 1 TB per TU Delft researcher per year

### [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

-   Zenodo is a general repository which has an integration with GitHub and thus allows you to get DOI's for your code/software.

-   You can also store presentations, education materials etc.

-   You can set up communities for your projects/section/department so all research outputs are easily findable. You can find an example community of the Data Stewards [here](https://zenodo.org/communities/datastewards/).

-   Zenodo is free to use and has a file size limit per record is 50GB (with exemptions on a case-by-case basis).

## Disciplinary specific data repositories

you can use [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) to look up a suitable repository for your data. Use the same keywords you would use to find articles of your research disicpline.

These sources contain recommended disciplinary specific data repositories:

-   [Elixir Databases for Biomolecular Data](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases)

-   Springer Nature [Data Repository Guidance](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositorieshttps://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/recommended-repositories)

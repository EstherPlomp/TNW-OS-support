A **data management plan** (DMP) is a document that describes:

**During the project:**

-   What data/code will be collected/generated or reused?

-   How and where will the data/code be stored and backed up?

-   Who will have access to the data/code and how?

-   How will the data/code be organised and documented?

    -   Can you easily figure out which file is what?

    -   If you open some of the files, are they properly labelled and described?

    -   If the individual responsible for data collection would leave the university, can you still make sense of the data without their input?

**After the project:**

-   Where will the data/code be stored and for how long?

-   Who will have access to the data/code and how?

-   What [licence](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/licenses/) will be the most suitable for the data (and code)?

See [The Turing Way for more details about what a Data Management Plan](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp.html) should contain.

## How to set up a DMP?

You can use the Word templates below, or the online platform, [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/), to fill out your Data Management Plan.

Main differences between the online platform and word templates:

-   The online platform makes collaboration on templates easier as everyone will have access to the latest version

-   Word templates keep the original format of the template, which looks nicer.

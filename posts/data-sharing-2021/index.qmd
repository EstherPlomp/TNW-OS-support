## Managing and Sharing Data in 2021

This post is based on an earlier [blogpost](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2021/09/17/managing-and-sharing-data-in-2021/).

## **NWO/Horizon Europe projects have the following requirements:**

**Data management** should follow the [FAIR principles](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/FAIR/) to maximise the effectiveness and reproducibility of the research undertaken. 

-   The **FAIR principles** recommend that scientific data are: 

    -   '**F**indable' thanks to their persistent identifier that is assigned to your dataset when it is shared using a data repository (see below).

    -   '**A**ccessible' so that the data and metadata can be examined; FAIR data is not necessarily open data, but the metadata could still be shared to ensure that the data is still FAIR.

    -   '**I**nteroperable' so that comparable data can be analysed and integrated through the use of common vocabulary and formats.

    -   '**R**eusable' as a result of appropriate documentation and provision of a [license](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/use/publish-cite/upload-your-data-in-our-data-repository/licencing) that tells others what they can do with the data.

## **Proposals**

-   Proposals have a data section that asks about how you will manage and share your data.

-   Consider any [data management costs](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/plan/data-management-costs) that need to be included in the project's budget. Also keep in mind that you may need a budget to [publish articles](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2020/11/19/publishing-articles-in-2021/). 

-   See the [TU Delft guidance](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/plan/grant-proposals/data-management-sections-for-grant-proposals) for help or [contact your Faculty's Data Steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact). 

## **Data Management Plans**

**Data Management Plans (DMP) are required** for projects funded by NWO (within four months after the awarding of the grant) and Horizon Europe (within 6 months of the project's start). 

-   DMP templates are available on the websites of [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-data-management) and [Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan-template_he_en.docx), as well as on the platform [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) that you can use with your netID. 

    -   DMPonline has TU Delft specific guidance that will help you to set up your DMP more efficiently. 

    -   You can also use the [TU Delft template available through DMPonline](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/plan/dmponline/dmponline) (although this will need some additions for Horizon Europe as this template is more extensive). It is especially efficient to use the TU Delft template if your project needs [HREC approval](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/human-research-ethics) (for example, working with [personal data](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/privacy-security/privacy)).

-   A DMP should be a living document, which is updated as the project evolves. Horizon Europe expects you to update the template throughout the project.

## **Data sharing**

**Data should be shared through a trusted repository**, for example: [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info//en/).

-   **Data underpinning a scientific publication** should be deposited at the latest **at the time of publication.**

-   Data is **in principle open**, unless restricted access is needed for legitimate reasons

    -   Access can be restricted when it concerns aspects such as privacy, public security, ethical limitations, property rights and commercial interest.

-   For Horizon Europe, the data should be licensed using CC-BY or CC0 (or an equivalent license), and metadata of the datasets should be CC0 licensed. 

    -   For [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) it means that others should cite the work when they reuse the data. 

    -   [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) waives any rights, with citation still being expected as this follows best scientific practises. 

    -   Note that some Horizon Europe calls may require additional obligations for the validations of scientific publications. 

-   These requirements are in line with the [TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2573159), stating that "*research data, code and any other materials needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented and shared in a research data repository in accordance with the FAIR principles for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, unless there are valid reasons not to do so*." (NWO also expects data preservation for at least ten years, unless legal provisions or discipline-specific guidelines dictate otherwise).

## **Software**

**Software** is seen as a separate research output from data:

-   Horizon Europe recommends sharing software (under an Open Source license).

-   NWO expects that software that is needed to access and interpret the data is made available, following the[Five Recommendations for FAIR Software](https://fair-software.nl/).

-   See the [TU Delft Research Software Policy](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629662) for more information on how to share your research software. 

    -   TU Delft encourages you to share your code/software through[4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) choosing one of the TU Delft approved licenses (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0). You can also choose another data repository, such as[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), but then you have to ensure that the output is correctly registered in PURE yourself. See the [TU Delft Guidelines on Research Software](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629635) or [this recording](https://youtu.be/bPl5sdTvLMM?t=1394) for more information on sharing your software/code.

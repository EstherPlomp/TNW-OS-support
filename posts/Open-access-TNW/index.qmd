This post contains an overview of Gold Open Access journals that TNW/Applied Sciences researchers are publishing in.

Gold Open Access here means that there are **no articles behind a paywall** (whereas hybrid journals offer both paywall and Open Access options). These journals are listed in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org).

Spreadsheets are great for certain purposes, but there are some things you need to keep in mind!

## Spreadsheets are great for:

-   Data entry

-   Tables for publications

-   Generate summary statistics

-   Figures

## Spreadsheets can be not so great:

-   Manual data entry is liable to mistakes (copy pasting wrong cells, accidental deletions)

-   It is not always machine readable. Software cannot process information that relies on context, notes in the margin, spatial layout or field formatting (bold/italics/colours)

-   Excel tries to convert everything into a date. [Even human genes](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates). (Watch a short talk on '[Spreadsheet Problems In Genomic Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrbkYm1P9xQ)' for more fun, or [read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008984)!)

## Set up a spreadsheet

-   Be consistent

-   Write dates like YYYYMMDD (consider to split info)

-   Do not leave empty values (use NA)

    -   It is difficult for empty cells to know if a value is missing, and blanks can be confusing when spaces/tabs are used as delimiters

    -   Whatever null value you use, use it consistently and indicate it in the README

-   Put as few information possible in a single cell and one observation per row

-   Create a data dictionary that describes the spreadsheet and any cleaning steps you took

-   Leave the raw data alone!

-   Do not use formatting (colours, font, bolding)

-   Use data validation to avoid errors (OpenRefine)

-   Avoid empty cells (not clear whether data was not collected or whether nothing was measured - use undefined, NA, 0, or null instead).

## Tidy Data

[![](images/tidydata_1.jpg){fig-alt="Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure, according to Hadley Wickham. In tidy data, each variable forms a colum, each observation forms a row, each cell is a single measurement."}](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/)

## Data validation

-   [Excel support page on data validation](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Apply-data-validation-to-cells-29FECBCC-D1B9-42C1-9D76-EFF3CE5F7249)
-   Check manually whether your data is consistent, complete and correct:
    -   If a column should contain only numeric values or characters, check that there are no non-numeric values or non-character
    -   Check for consistency in names, unit of measurements, data type and so on
    -   Check if there are any empty cells and replace them with your chosen null value (see above)

## Accessibility ([Data Curation Primer](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/master/Accessibility%20Data%20Curation%20Primer/accessibility-data-curation-primer.md#tabular))

Comma- or Tab-Separated Value (CSV/TSV) formats are not only best for preservation, but for accessibility as well. For more information:

Spreadsheets are great for certain purposes, but there are some things you need to keep in mind!

## Spreadsheets are great for:

-   Data entry

-   Tables for publications

-   Generate summary statistics

-   Figures

## Spreadsheets can be not so great:

-   Manual data entry is liable to mistakes (copy pasting wrong cells, accidental deletions)

-   It is not always machine readable. Software cannot process information that relies on context, notes in the margin, spatial layout or field formatting (bold/italics/colours)

-   Excel tries to convert everything into a date. [Even human genes](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates).

## Set up a spreadsheet

-   Be consistent

-   Write dates like YYYYMMDD (consider to split info)

-   Do not leave empty values (use NA)

-   Put as few information possible in a single cell and one observation per row

-   Create a data dictionary that describes the spreadsheet and any cleaning steps you took

-   Leave the raw data alone!

-   Do not use formatting (colours, font, bolding)

-   Use data validation to avoid errors (OpenRefine)

-   Avoid empty cells (not clear whether data was not collected or whether nothing was measured - use undefined, NA, 0, or null instead).

## Tidy Data

[![](images/tidydata_1.jpg){fig-alt="Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure, according to Hadley Wickham. In tidy data, each variable forms a colum, each observation forms a row, each cell is a single measurement."}](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/)

## Data validation

### Using schemas to check your tabular data:

try.goodtables.io (or python library github.com/frictionlessdata/goodtables-py / github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py) (see [this presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAi4OnfH-Q&feature=youtu.be))

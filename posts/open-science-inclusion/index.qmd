### Gender

-   [Meta-Research: Systemic racial disparities in funding rates at the National Science Foundation](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83071)

-   [The gendered nature of independence in the context of research funding and excellence](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43545-022-00563-w)

-   [The Glass Obstacle Course: Informal and Formal Barriers For Women Ph.D. Students in STEM Fields](https://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/205)

-   [The extent and drivers of gender imbalance in neuroscience reference lists](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y)

-   Papers authored by women are rated lower or have lower acceptance rates in academic journals ([Fox et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4993); [Hagan et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01680-20); [Murray et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/400515); [Walker et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6012.2))

-   *"Numerous studies have demonstrated that the use of standardized proxies of performance, such as journal ratings and impact factors, can reinforce existing gender inequalities in scientific organizations*" ([Brooks et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2013.12.005), [Hunter et al. 2010](https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312709358472), [Nielsen et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2015.1075197) in [Nielsen et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0433-1))

    80\.

-   18.43-fold more women and 13.34-fold more men receive more recognition with article-level metrics ([Arabi et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.07.556750))

-   [Journals invite too few women to referee](https://doi.org/10.1038/541455a)

-   ...[exact parity could be achieved as late as 2027 for authoring, 2034 for reviewing and 2042 for editing](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21718).

The [**FEM/UM Citation Guide**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/athenasangels.nl/index.php?option=com_acym&ctrl=fronturl&task=click&urlid=488&userid=2191&mailid=92__;!!PAKc-5URQlI!-Z7wHi2Bk7Ca7fpj2Q2ZB-t3G1A2LFDUKD1wHCFd4EF_emK8FnrWZYb9H3PeYVn4Q9NFCBXqqhTQmsnIrRoEsg$) explains how women and other underrepresented groups can become more visible in science through citation practices

[Balanced citer](https://github.com/mb3152/balanced_citer) allow you to perform statistical analyses using Python to investigate the equality in gender and race of the first and last authors in your reference list.

### Race

-   Peer reviewers discriminate based on author race ([Nakamura et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.7554/%20eLife.71368))
-   Non-White scientists appear on fewer editorial boards, spend more time under review, and receive fewer citations ([Liu et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2215324120))
-   Black women in particular are affected by citation erasure ([Smith 2021](https://doi.org/10.14506/ca37.2.05))

### Language

-   Articles submitted to journals by authors from countries with low English proficiency fare worse during peer review than those with high English proficiency ([Burns & Fox 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2517-5); [Ross et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.295.14.1675); [Saposnik et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005413); [Tregenza 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02545-4); [Walker et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6012.2) - from [Fox et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14259){style="font-size: 11pt;"})

-   Journals are less likely to accept papers by researchers in countries where English is not a primary language \[25--27\].

-   [Non-native English researchers need:](https://theconversation.com/non-native-english-speaking-scientists-work-much-harder-just-to-keep-up-global-research-reveals-208750)

    -   up to 91% more time to read a paper in English

    -   up to 51% more time to write their own paper

    -   Their papers will be rejected 2.6 times more often by journals

    -   If accepted, they'll have to revise it 12.5 more times

    -   When they present in English (they will often avoid English speaking conferences and oral presentations), they need up to 94% more time to prepare their presentations.

## Resources

From [Fox et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14259):

-   Peer reviewers favour articles by authors from higher-income ([Demarest et al. 2014](https://doi.%20org/10.1007/s1119%202-014-%201354-%20z); [Harris, Macinko, et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-017-0304-y); [Harris, Marti, et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0773); [Kowal et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-04176-7); [Saposnik et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005413))

-   or favour papers by authors that are from prestigious institutions ([Blank 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006906); [Tomkins et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114)),

-   or with prestigious reputations ([Huber et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205779119); [Okike et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2016.11014)),

-   favouring authors that are senior ([Pleskac et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/q2tkw)),

-   or disfavouring newcomers to a discipline ([Seeber & Bacchelli 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2264-7)).

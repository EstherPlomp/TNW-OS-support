Documentation is important to understand the data/code. This post provides information about documentation, file naming and metadata.

## Documentation

It is important to document your data, as it provides the contextual information needed to interpret the data. Data documentation includes information on the context of the data collection (project objectives and hypotheses), data collection methods (sampling, data collection process, analysis instruments used, software used to process the data etc), temporal and geographic coverage and by whom the data collection took place. Where multiple datasets or multiple versions of the same dataset are generated, the relationship between (the versions of) datasets should be clear.

## File naming convention

Structure your file names and set up a template for this. It is very useful to start with the date (when the file was generated: YYYYMMDD) which will sort your files chronologically and also creates a unique identifier for each file. (It will be immediately clear if there are multiple files generated on the same day that will have to be given a version number --or "A, B"-, because otherwise overwriting would occurs if you store these files in the proper folder).

Examples:\
**20190607_ImPhys_RDMTemplate_v001_eng**

-   Date or date range of experiment: YYYYMMDD

-   File type (or language such as the example above)

-   Researcher name/initials

-   Version number of file (v001, v002)

-   Don't make file names too long (30-70 characters should do the trick)

-   Avoid special characters (?\\!\@\*%{\[\<\>) and spaces

You can explain the file naming convention in a README.txt file, so that it will also become clear to others what the file names mean.

### Bulk renaming tools (use with care!):

-   Windows: [Ant Renamer](http://www.antp.be/software/renamer), [RenameIT](sourceforge.net/prpjects/renameit), [Bulk Rename Utility](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/)

-   Mac: [Renamer](https://renamer.com/), [Name Changer](https://mrrsoftware.com/namechanger/)

-   Linux: [GNOME Commander](https://gcmd.github.io/), [GPRename](http://gprename.sourceforge.net/)

-   Unix: Using the grep command to search for regular expressions

## Metadata

Metadata is information about your data, such as the title of the dataset, the date, creator(s) and keywords that describe the data. Metadata standards with defined fields ensure machine readability. To look for disciplinary standards you can use the resources below:

• [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)

• [Research Data Alliance metadata directory](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/)

• [Digital Curation Center](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards)

### Tools available for metadata creation:

<https://frictionlessdata.io/> create.frictionlessdata.io (Data Package Creator) (JSON) (or through Python, [github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-pipelines)) (see [this presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAi4OnfH-Q&feature=youtu.be))

## Physical samples

Reference your samples: dates in notebooks + supplier's name/code

Add any relevant notes:

The first column describes sample names, the second the accompanying data in the labbook, the third column the amount of samples left (if there are multiple), the fourth one is the sample sizes and the last column contains any notes about the sample."}

## Electronic Lab Notebooks

TU Delft provides licenses for [RSpace and eLABjournal](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/manage/electronic-lab-notebook).

You can also keep a digital copy in solutions such as OneNote, or [logseq](https://www.dannygarside.co.uk/blog/An-open-source-knowledge-management-system-for-the-lab/).

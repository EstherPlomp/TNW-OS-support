This is a short checklist for supervisors of PhD projects that need to share the research outputs related to the PhD dissertation.

In accordance with the [TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/researchdata-framework-policy.pdf), **all PhD candidates are required to share their research data and code underlying their dissertations before graduating**, unless there are valid reasons not to do so or they started their PhD project before 2019.Â 

The PhD team should check whether the data and code has been shared before signing [Form B](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/graduate-school-forms?p_l_back_url=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dgraduate%2Bschool%2Bforms).

Tips on how to share the data/code:

-   Check the Data Management Plan for the plans on where the data should be shared. Data should be shared via data repositories such as [4TU.ResearchData](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/4TU-info/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [discipline specific data repositories](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-how/#where-discipline-specific-repository).

    -   Check posts on [what data to share](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-what/), [how to share data and code](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-how-PhD/)

    -   Not all data and code can be shared: Check [examples](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547667) and [advice](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/buttons/faqs#c547686) about what to do in such cases

-   If some of the data and code have already been shared, as there are already publications with underlying data/code shared, do you have a list of the DOIs of these datasets and software repositories?

-   How will you share the data/code that is not shared yet? Is an embargo required?

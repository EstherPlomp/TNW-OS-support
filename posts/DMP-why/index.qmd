A data management plan (DMP) is a document that describes:

**During the project:**

-   What data/code will be collected/generated or reused?

-   How and where will the data/code be stored and backed up?

-   Who will have access to the data/code and how?

-   How will the data/code be documented?

**After the project:**

-   Where will the data/code be stored and for how long?

-   Who will have access to the data/code and how?

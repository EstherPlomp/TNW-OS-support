Rights Retention Strategy was initiated by cOAlition S to ensure that the researchers they fund can publish Open Access, but is a strategy that can be applied by any researcher when submitting a manuscript to a journal.

By employing the Rights Retention Strategy you retain your rights on the manuscripts, which gives you the right to share the author's version of the article, after peerreview, through a repository. This is Green Open Access, but then without the embargo period (generally 6-48 months) that journals usually place on this version of the article.

When you choose a NC or NC-ND license, publishers take over the control of authorisations where only they can make and authorise derivatives and commercially use your work. This copyright transfer has only been [introduced relatively recent](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/06/03/what-the-history-of-copyright-in-academic-publishing-tells-us-about-open-research/) and is not something that is essential for the publishing process.

*"As author(s) and original copyright holder(s) of this submission, I/we have applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version arising from this submission. If the article is accepted for publication, I/we will make the AAM available without embargo in a repository. Please confirm by return that the author(s) will NOT be required to sign a contract that prevents this action. If I/we do not hear from you before DD/MM/YYYY, I/we will seek a different journal that will accept my/our manuscript under these conditions."*

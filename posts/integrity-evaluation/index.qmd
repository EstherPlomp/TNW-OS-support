### Gender

-   [Meta-Research: Systemic racial disparities in funding rates at the National Science Foundation](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83071)
-   [The gendered nature of independence in the context of research funding and excellence](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43545-022-00563-w)
-   [The Glass Obstacle Course: Informal and Formal Barriers For Women Ph.D. Students in STEM Fields](https://genderandset.open.ac.uk/index.php/genderandset/article/view/205)
-   [The extent and drivers of gender imbalance in neuroscience reference lists](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y)
-   papers authored by women are rated lower or have lower acceptance rates in academic journals (Fox et al., 2019; Murray et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2015)

The [**FEM/UM Citation Guide**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/athenasangels.nl/index.php?option=com_acym&ctrl=fronturl&task=click&urlid=488&userid=2191&mailid=92__;!!PAKc-5URQlI!-Z7wHi2Bk7Ca7fpj2Q2ZB-t3G1A2LFDUKD1wHCFd4EF_emK8FnrWZYb9H3PeYVn4Q9NFCBXqqhTQmsnIrRoEsg$) explains how women and other underrepresented groups can become more visible in science through citation practices

[Balanced citer](https://github.com/mb3152/balanced_citer) allow you to perform statistical analyses using Python to investigate the equality in gender and race of the first and last authors in your reference list.

### Race

-   Peer reviewers discriminate based on author race ([Nakamura et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.7554/%20eLife.71368))

### Language

Articles submitted to journals by authors from countries with low English proficiency fare worse during peer review than those with high English proficiency ([Burns & Fox 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2517-5); [Ross et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.295.14.1675); [Saposnik et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005413); [Tregenza 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02545-4); [Walker et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6012.2) - from [Fox et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14259){style="font-size: 11pt;"})

Resources

-   From [Fox et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14259): Peer reviewers favour articles by authors from higher-income ([Demarest et al. 2014](https://doi.%20org/10.1007/s1119%202-014-%201354-%20z); [Harris, Macinko, et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-017-0304-y); [Harris, Marti, et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0773); [Kowal et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-04176-7); [Saposnik et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005413)) or favour papers by authors that are from prestigious institutions ([Blank 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006906); [Tomkins et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114)) or with prestigious reputations ([Huber et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2205779119); [Okike et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2016.11014)), favouring authors that are senior ([Pleskac et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/q2tkw)), or disfavouring newcomers to a discipline ([Seeber & Bacchelli 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2264-7))

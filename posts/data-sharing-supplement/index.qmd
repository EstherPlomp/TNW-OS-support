## 
Why not supplemental materials?

**Data control**: cannot be updated, unlike materials available at data repositories.

**Interoperability**: If publishers only allow text and PDF formats it hampers data sharing and it will be difficult to reuse the data

**Availability**: Difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)

**Not FAIR**: Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be [FAIR](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable) - since they do not have a DOI assigned to them specifically (see also the Availability point above).

**Impact**: Data should be a primary research output

**Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead

**Size limits**: There may be size limits in place of how large or how many supplementary materials can be shared.

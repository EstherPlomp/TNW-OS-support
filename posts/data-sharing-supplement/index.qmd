## 

Why not supplemental materials?

**Data control**: cannot be updated, unlike materials available at data repositories.

**Interoperability**: If publishers only allow text and PDF formats it hampers data sharing and it will be difficult to reuse the data

**Availability**: Difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)

**Not FAIR**: Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be [FAIR](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable) - since they do not have a DOI assigned to them specifically (see also the Availability point above).

**Impact**: Data should be a primary research output

**Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead

**Size limits**: There may be size limits in place of how large or how many supplementary materials can be shared.

Links to supplemental materials may also break, as demonstrated in the example below:

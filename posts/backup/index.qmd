To avoid losing your data, you should follow recommended **backup practices**:

-   You should have 2 or 3 copies of your files, stored on

-   at least 2 different storage media,

-   in different (physical) locations.

The more important the data and the more often the datasets change, the more frequently you should back them up.

Automatic backup is preferred!

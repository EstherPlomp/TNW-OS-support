A **preprint** is the version of the article before peer review.

You can share your preprint on a preprint server or repository even before you have submitted it to a journal. Before you share a preprint, check if the journal allows sharing of preprints via [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

## Why should I share a preprint?

-   You can immediately share a preprint, instead of waiting for the review/publishing process.

-   Preprinted articles have increased citations of the published versions, because people are able to read your work earlier and incorporate it.

-   Preprints are openly accessible, without fees for readers and authors

-   Preprints provide evidence of productivity (Instead of adding papers that are still under review to your CV)

-   You can establish priority via preprints

-   Preprint servers also allow for sharing of negative/inconclusive results, or other work not intended to be submitted for journal publication (such as open letters)

-   posting a preprint is associated with higher social media attention (Fraser et al., 2020; Fu & Hughey, 2019; Serghiou & Ioannidis, 2018).

-   Some journals have appointed designated 'preprint editors' who scout the latest research posted at preprint servers and invite submissions to their journal ([Puebla et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12412508)).

-   Preprints allow for feedback at a stage where this can still be incorporated

-   Accelerated speed of scientific discovery and prevention of duplication of research efforts

## Where to share a preprint?

-   Preprint servers such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (Physics) and [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) (Biology)

-   Repositories such as [OSF](https://osf.io/preprints/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

-   TU Delft Open.

## Terminology

-   **Preprint**: version of the article before peer review

-   **Post-print** (or Author Accepted Manuscript - AAM): version of the article after peer review

-   **Publishers version** (Version of Record - VOR): fully formatted version published by the publisher

A **preprint** is the version of the article before peer review.

You can share your preprint on a preprint server or repository even before you have submitted it to a journal. Before you share a preprint, check if the journal allows sharing of preprints via [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

## Why should I share a preprint?

-   You can immediately share a preprint, instead of waiting for the review/publishing process.

-   Preprinted articles have increased citations of the published versions, because people are able to read your work earlier and incorporate it.

## Where to share a preprint?

-   Preprint servers such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (Physics) and [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) (Biology)

-   Repositories such as [OSF](https://osf.io/preprints/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

-   TU Delft Open.

-   **Preprint**: version of the article before peer review

A **preprint** is the version of the article before peer review.

You can share your preprint on a preprint server or repository even before you have submitted it to a journal. Before you share a preprint, check if the journal allows sharing of preprints via [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

## Why should I share a preprint?

-   You can immediately share a preprint, instead of waiting for the review/publishing process.

-   Preprinted articles have increased citations of the published versions, because people are able to read your work earlier and incorporate it.

-   Preprints are openly accessible, without fees for readers and authors

-   Preprints provide evidence of productivity (Instead of adding papers that are still under review to your CV)

-   You can establish priority via preprints

-   Preprint servers also allow for sharing of negative/inconclusive results, or other work not intended to be submitted for journal publication (such as open letters)

-   posting a preprint is associated with higher social media attention (Fraser et al., 2020; Fu & Hughey, 2019; Serghiou & Ioannidis, 2018).

-   Some journals have appointed designated 'preprint editors' who scout the latest research posted at preprint servers and invite submissions to their journal ([Puebla et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12412508)).

-   Preprints allow for feedback at a stage where this can still be incorporated

-   Accelerated speed of scientific discovery and prevention of duplication of research efforts

## Where to share a preprint?

-   Preprint servers such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (Physics) and [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) (Biology)

-   Repositories such as [OSF](https://osf.io/preprints/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

-   TU Delft Open.

## Terminology

-   **Preprint**: version of the article before peer review

-   **Post-print** (or Author Accepted Manuscript - AAM): version of the article after peer review

-   **Publishers version** (Version of Record - VOR): fully formatted version published by the publisher

Peer reviewed journal articles may involve multiple journals or review rounds, with possible multiple steps for submission and review, resulting in a published article that can take up to a year.  Preprints can be posted to a preprint server within 1-2 days, where the community can provide feedback and review which can still be incorporated in any updates of the article.  Preprints can provide proof of productivity (funders now accept them, and preprints receive a DOI and can be cited). They also increase visibility as they are available via search tools such as Google Scholar. They are compatible with journals as most journals now accept preprints. They may also protect you from being scooped as the preprint has release date."}](https://mas.to/@ASAPbio/111228550478598057)

## How should I cite/refer to data in my paper?

A dataset citation includes all of the same components as any other citation:

● author

● title

● year of publication

● publisher (for data, this is often the repository where it is housed, such as [4TU.ResearchData](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/))

● version (if indicated)

● access information (a URL or DOI)

::: callout-note
**APA style example:**\
Author/Rightsholder. (Year). Title of data set (Version number) \[Description of form\]. \[Retrieved from https://\] *OR* \[DOI\]

**DataCite citation style:\
**Creator (PublicationYear). Title. Version. Publisher. ResourceType. Identifier (Version and ResourceType are optional)

Example:\
Heydarian, H. (Hamidreza); Schueder, F. (Florian); Strauss, M.T. (Maximilian); van Werkhoven, B. (Ben); Fazel, M. (Mohamadreza); Lidke, K.A. (Keith); Jungmann, R. (Ralf); Stallinga, S. (Sjoerd); Rieger, B. (Bernd) (2018) Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) 2D TU Delft logos. TU Delft. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:0d42a28f-f625-41a3-ba77-25e397685466

At [4TU.ResearchData](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/) you can click on the "Cite" button to get a suggested citation and to obtain the DOI of the dataset:

You can also check <http://citeas.org/> to see how you should cite a resource.

You should cite your dataset directly in the paper in places where it is relevant, and include a citation in your reference list, as well as include a **Data availability statement** at the end of the paper (before the acknowledgement section). See below for some examples. [It is important to cite the software, as the data availability statement does not count as a citation!]{.underline}

## When data cannot be made available:

Restrictions apply to the data/software that support the findings of this study. \[Explain nature of restrictions e.g. the data contains information that could compromise the privacy of research participants, NDA, licensing, agreements\] Data are available upon reasonable request by contacting \[name and contact details\] and with permission of \[third party name\].

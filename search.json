This is Green Open Access, but then without the embargo period (generally 6-48 months) that journals usually place on this version of the article.\nWhen you choose a NC or NC-ND license, publishers take over the control of authorisations where only they can make and authorise derivatives and commercially use your work. This copyright transfer has only been introduced relatively recent and is not something that is essential for the publishing process.\n“As author(s) and original copyright holder(s) of this submission, I/we have applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM) version arising from this submission. If the article is accepted for publication, I/we will make the AAM available without embargo in a repository. Please confirm by return that the author(s) will NOT be required to sign a contract that prevents this action. If I/we do not hear from you before DD/MM/YYYY, I/we will seek a different journal that will accept my/our manuscript under these conditions.”\n“For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.”\nExamples of articles that used the Rights Retention Strategy (from Mounce 2022)"

This post is based on the guidance note on reviewing Data Management Plans.\n\n\nYou are not obliged to ask the Data Steward for support on a DMP, but they can provide you with valuable input on the DMP and check whether the answers make sense.\n\n\n\nEnsure that the data will be stored using a storage solution that is automatically backed up and that all project members have access to the data they need to have access to (especially important that access is restricted when working with personal data or confidential data - see number 4).\n\n\n\nCan you easily figure out which file is what? If you open some of the files, are they properly labelled and described? If the individual responsible for data collection would leave the university, can you still make sense of the data without their input? See the data organisation/documentation post for more information.\n\n\n\nAnd are they handling this confidential data properly? Here the advise of the Data Steward can come in extra handy and is required for personal data (as part of the HREC application).\nConfidential data can contain:\n\npersonal information which can allow the identification of living individuals\ncommercially-confidential information (e.g. something you might want to patent, or data belonging to a third party)\nInformation related to national security , export control regulations etc.\n\n\n\n\nTU Delft Research Data Framework Policy requires all PhD students who started on or after 1 January 2019 to deposit research data (and code) supporting their theses before they can graduate .\n\nDid the project team agree what data (and code), when and how will be shared? (See what data should be shared post)\nWill there be any difficulties with data sharing (perhaps not all data is suitable for sharing)?\nWhat licence will be the most suitable for the data (and code)?\n\nIn principle, for most research done at TU Delft, it is suitable to make the data and code underpinning research findings available in a data repository. Typically, this is done at the same time as publishing the related papers, theses or reports. TU Delft has a dedicated data repository, 4TU.ResearchData, where all TU Delft researchers can deposit up to 1TB of data per year (per researcher) free of charge. Discipline specific repositories might also be suitable (the Data Steward can advise)."

For commercial companies who would like to use the software, but do not want to share the source code, you can sell/provide them a proprietary license that does not oblige them to release the source code."

If the version is unidentified or unknown, the date of access should be used.\n• Type: some citation styles (e.g., APA), require a bracketed description of the citation (e.g., [Computer software]) to be included.\nIf a published article exists that describes the software, it should be cited as an additional reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample (APA): Developer, A.

    "text": "This post has been adapted from the Turing Way (The Turing Way Community, The Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science. 10.5281/zenodo.3233853) and a blogpost on Open Working under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.\nA Data Article (also known as a Data Paper/Note/Release, or Database article) is a publication that is focused on the description of a dataset. It uses the traditional journal article structure, but focuses on the data-collection and methodological aspects and generally not on the interpretation or discussion of the results. Data articles are in line with the FAIR principles, especially since most publishers will encourage you to share the data through a data repository. The benefit of a Data Article is that your output will be peer reviewed, something which is generally not the case for datasets that are archived on data repositories. It also facilitates recognition for datasets through research assessment procedures that are more traditionally focused on publication output. Publishing a data paper will therefore increase the visibility, credibility and usability of the data, as well as giving you credit as a data producer (The Turing Way Community 2022)."

Enter username or email of the person you want to invite and change the role to ‘Owner’. Click ‘Invite’.)\n\n\n\nHave a maintainer of the project repository transfer it to the group namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings > General > Advanced > Transfer Project)\n\n\n\nAfter doing this, the maintainer(s) of the project will get an email notifying that the project has been moved to a different location.\nNow the person who the project is being transferred to can move it to their own namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar, go to Settings > General > Advanced > Transfer Project like before).\nIf desired, the group can be deleted after the transfer is complete (go to the group namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings > General > Advanced > Remove Group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProviding a more straightforward way to transfer ownership in Gitlab was raised as an issue in 2016, which is unfortunately still open."

    "text": "5. Is there a clear strategy for data sharing?\nTU Delft Research Data Framework Policy requires all PhD students who started on or after 1 January 2019 to deposit research data (and code) supporting their theses before they can graduate .\n\nDid the project team agree what data (and code), when and how will be shared? (See what data should be shared post)\nWill there be any difficulties with data sharing (perhaps not all data is suitable for sharing)?\nWhat licence will be the most suitable for the data (and code)?\n\nIn principle, for most research done at TU Delft, it is suitable to make the data and code underpinning research findings available in a data repository. Typically, this is done at the same time as publishing the related papers, theses or reports. TU Delft has a dedicated data repository, 4TU.ResearchData, where all TU Delft researchers can deposit up to 1TB of data per year (per researcher) free of charge. Discipline specific repositories might also be suitable (the Data Steward can advise)."

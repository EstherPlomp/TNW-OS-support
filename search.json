Enter username or email of the person you want to invite and change the role to ‘Owner’. Click ‘Invite’.)\n\n\n\nHave a maintainer of the project repository transfer it to the group namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Transfer Project).\n\n\n\nAfter doing this, the maintainer(s) of the project will get an email notifying that the project has been moved to a different location.\nNow the person who the project is being transferred to can move it to their own namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Transfer Project like before).\nIf desired, the group can be deleted after the transfer is complete (go to the group namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Remove Group).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProviding a more straightforward way to transfer ownership in Gitlab was raised as an issue in 2016, which is unfortunately still open."

You can also let others know how to cite you in this README file.\nEnsure that you selected a license for your data and code: without it your research objects cannot be reused by others.\nProvide the DOI of your research objects where it is relevant (for example, table/figure descriptions, materials and methods section, data/code availability statement).\nCheck whether you cited your data and code in the references: this is where citations are counted from - not the acknowledgements or data availability statements.

To provide access to additional people you can add them when you request the drive via Topdesk, you can contact the Service Desk of your faculty (servicepuntTNW [at] tudelft.nl), or you can add them using UMRA (see TU Delft ICT for more UMRA manuals).\n\nNote that anyone with access to the Project Drive will have viewing or editing rights for the entire Project Drive, unless you’re using UMRA. If you want to easily manage access permissions it may be needed to request multiple Project Drives or work with alternative storage solutions such as SURF/OneDrive.\nEvery account has to be traceable to a person (so not a research group).\nIt is helpful to keep a list of users that have access to your Project Drive(s), since there is no interface that provides you this overview.\n\nThe Project Drive requires an internet connection.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This posts is a summary of the talk given by Deborah Stone for the LIS-Bibliometrics Conference 2022.\nWhat is the idea of the nature of the thing that you’re trying to count? Categories are human decisions. Once you decide what belongs in the category you counting, you predetermine the number you’ll find. This is why every number is just a snake eating it’s tail.\nThree points:\nHumans create numbers. Then they claim that their creations are independent of their own subjective judgements. Numbers are no more objective than words.\nIf we know numbers aren’t objective: Why do we use them anyway to guide important decisions?\nPeople want to use numbers, however crude they are, because we fear that the officials who have power over us, might be biased or play favourites. By setting firm, objective criteria to constrain them, we hope to reduce whim, favouritism, and prejudice. We call for numbers to protect ourselves from arbitrary power. Thats why so many institutions that evaluate programmes and people are increasingly using metrics instead of human judges, to promote fairness. Or so the argument goes.\nEvaluation by numbers is supposed to make the people being evaluated feel that they are being treated objectively and fairly. Numbers make human judges feel more confident in their judgement. They rather hide behind the numbers.\nOnce we entrust ourselves to numbers, the snake is eating us, not its own tail.\nPeople have long realised that numbers aren’t the objective gods that we’d like to believe.\nBefore we think about alternatives measures of impact. What are the hidden impacts of journals, articles and other research outputs that bibliometrics don’t measure?\nThe JIF as an evaluation tool creates pressures to conformity and discourages creativity. Citation serves as a mechanism for maintaining hierarchy in the profession. Journals with low JIF scores can still have a huge impact on scientific progress.\nHow might we better evaluate the impact of research and publications?\nBibliometrics is both a commercial industry and a device for maintaining the status-quo hierarchy of knowledge producers. But if enough will practice these methods we can create a parallel universe in which evaluators and evaluated feel more honest, appreciated and effective."

For example, reviewers may be more likely to reject research that challenges their own views or that comes from researchers they do not know.There is also a bias in valuing positive results more than negative results.\nLack of diversity: Since identities of peer reviewers are often not known, it is difficult to assess their backgrounds, which can result in a lack of representation and potentially biased evaluations.\nLimited expertise: Reviewers may not have the necessary expertise to evaluate certain types of research, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate evaluations.\nSlow turnaround time: The peer review process can be slow, with some studies taking months or even years to be reviewed and published. This can delay the dissemination of important research findings. (See Preprints)\nLack of transparency: The peer review process is often not transparent, as peer reviewer identities are unknown and reviews are not always public. (see Open Peer Review)\nAgreement among reviewers is weak\nRejections/acceptation decisions are inconsistent\nMajor errors and flaws are inconsistently discovered"

In general, permissively licensed code is forward compatible with any other license type. However, only permissive licenses, such as the BSD and MIT, can feed into other permissive licenses. Restrictive licenses like the GPL are backward compatible with themselves and permissive licenses, but must adopt the restrictive license from then on. Proprietary licenses can incorporate upstream permissively licensed code, but by definition are incompatible with any other downstream license. Grey represents actions that are not permitted without negotiating a separate license agreement with the rights owner. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598.g002"

This post is based on the guidance note on reviewing Data Management Plans.\n\n\nYou are not obliged to ask the Data Steward for support on a DMP, but they can provide you with valuable input on the DMP and check whether the answers make sense.\n\n\n\nEnsure that the data will be stored using a storage solution that is automatically backed up and that all project members have access to the data they need to have access to (especially important that access is restricted when working with personal data or confidential data - see number 4).\n\n\n\nCan you easily figure out which file is what? If you open some of the files, are they properly labelled and described? If the individual responsible for data collection would leave the university, can you still make sense of the data without their input? See the data organisation/documentation post for more information.\n\n\n\nAnd are they handling this confidential data properly? Here the advise of the Data Steward can come in extra handy and is required for personal data (as part of the HREC application).\nConfidential data can contain:\n\npersonal information which can allow the identification of living individuals\ncommercially-confidential information (e.g. something you might want to patent, or data belonging to a third party)\nInformation related to national security , export control regulations etc.\n\n\n\n\nTU Delft Research Data Framework Policy requires all PhD students who started on or after 1 January 2019 to deposit research data (and code) supporting their theses before they can graduate .\n\nDid the project team agree what data (and code), when and how will be shared? (See what data should be shared post)\nWill there be any difficulties with data sharing (perhaps not all data is suitable for sharing)?\nWhat licence will be the most suitable for the data (and code)?\n\nIn principle, for most research done at TU Delft, it is suitable to make the data and code underpinning research findings available in a data repository. Typically, this is done at the same time as publishing the related papers, theses or reports. TU Delft has a dedicated data repository, 4TU.ResearchData, where all TU Delft researchers can deposit up to 1TB of data per year (per researcher) free of charge. Discipline specific repositories might also be suitable (the Data Steward can advise)."

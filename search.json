    "section": "",
    "text": "This posts is a summary of the talk given by Deborah Stone for the LIS-Bibliometrics Conference 2022.\nWhat is the idea of the nature of the thing that you’re trying to count? Categories are human decisions. Once you decide what belongs in the category you counting, you predetermine the number you’ll find. This is why every number is just a snake eating it’s tail.\nThree points:\nHumans create numbers. Then they claim that their creations are independent of their own subjective judgements. Numbers are no more objective than words.\nIf we know numbers aren’t objective: Why do we use them anyway to guide important decisions?\nPeople want to use numbers, however crude they are, because we fear that the officials who have power over us, might be biased or play favourites. By setting firm, objective criteria to constrain them, we hope to reduce whim, favouritism, and prejudice. We call for numbers to protect ourselves from arbitrary power. Thats why so many institutions that evaluate programmes and people are increasingly using metrics instead of human judges, to promote fairness. Or so the argument goes.\nEvaluation by numbers is supposed to make the people being evaluated feel that they are being treated objectively and fairly. Numbers make human judges feel more confident in their judgement. They rather hide behind the numbers.\nOnce we entrust ourselves to numbers, the snake is eating us, not its own tail.\nPeople have long realised that numbers aren’t the objective gods that we’d like to believe.\nBefore we think about alternatives measures of impact. What are the hidden impacts of journals, articles and other research outputs that bibliometrics don’t measure?\nThe JIF as an evaluation tool creates pressures to conformity and discourages creativity. Citation serves as a mechanism for maintaining hierarchy in the profession. Journals with low JIF scores can still have a huge impact on scientific progress.\nHow might we better evaluate the impact of research and publications?\nBibliometrics is both a commercial industry and a device for maintaining the status-quo hierarchy of knowledge producers. But if enough will practice these methods we can create a parallel universe in which evaluators and evaluated feel more honest, appreciated and effective."

    "section": "Six myths, busted",
    "text": "Six myths, busted\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements will lead to an equitable scholarly publishing ecosystem\n“To date, Transformative agreements are largely limited to research-intensive institutions and consortia. This creates a tiered access system to open publication for authors, potentially damaging both individual careers and the scholarly record’s integrity.”\n“Transformative agreements fail to create viable routes to paid Open Access publishing for the many researchers who do not have an institutional affiliation or are affiliated with less well-resourced institutions.”\n\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements are a proven way to transition the system from closed to open access\nPublishers promoting Transformative Agreements have not yet released their Open Access transition plans. Without transparency these agreements may lead to increased publisher revenue without a commitment to a full Open Access transition.\n\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements move away from an APC model of open access\ncombining subscription agreements with Article Processing Charges could lead to greater expenditures benefiting publishers.\nSome Transformative Agreements have a cap: if the number of OA articles an institution publishes exceeds expectations, that institution can be forced to limit Open Access publishing or pay individual Article Processing Chargesoutside of the deal.13 If output is lower than expected, institutions have likely agreed to a minimum spend, limiting risk for publishers. Transformative Agreements don’t eliminate Article Processing Charges they obfuscate them.\n\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements will lead to greater transparency regarding publication costs\nThe same publishers who have traditionally lacked transparency have balked at providing this data, claiming that doing so would be in breach of anti-competition or anti-trust law.15 Without transparent data it is hard to create and properly evaluate publishing models.\n\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements will lead to competitive pricing\n*“Competitive pricing* implies there is a market where publishers strategically price their product to vie for institutional spending. This, at a minimum, requires transparency of price and license terms. As Transformative Agreements are negotiated on an individual basis with widely varying structures, details are hard to obtain and difficult to compare..”\n\n“Publishers continue to enter negotiations with a full understanding of their agreements, and institutions have only partial data to inform their negotiations.”\n\n\nMyth: Transformative agreements better position libraries to negotiate\n“Even when authors pay Article Processing Charges themselves, they are price insensitive—they often favor publishing in more expensive, “prestigious” journals.19”\n“Transformative Agreements have the potential to set libraries up for difficult future negotiations—at the conclusion of a pilot agreement with favorable terms, publishers may direct pressure from authors to push libraries into less favorable agreements.”"

This may include:\n\nThorough description of data and processes\nTerms and conditions for reuse (license)\nLimitations, assumptions and shortcomings of the work\nContact information\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nData and code may have complex ownership involving multiple people and institutions, complicating sharing efforts. Sharing agreements made early in the research process can specify the plans for ultimately sharing data/code.\nAs TU Delft is your employer, it holds the right to any scientific research you work on\nResearch funding is public funding and should benefit the wider public\n\n\n\nSensitive Content\n\nNot all data can be shared publicly (see types of confidential data)\nIn some cases, aggregating, generalizing or anonymizing data can be used to remove sensitive information (see Sharing Sensitive Data)\nSharing information about the dataset publicly is following the FAIR principles, and will make the information about the dataset more findable. Researchers can then contact you if they would like to access the dataset.\nWhile open data is an important goal for advancing science, it must never perpetuate harm.\n\n\n\nTransient storage\n\nShare the data/code using a data repository\nAvoid proprietary file formats and software\nConsider the use of containers such as Docker/Binder."

Some curation is unavoidable. The volume of data collected in a modern physics laboratory is high: computer scripts control the equipment, which might run 24 hours a day. A remedy is to clearly explain the protocol that is used to perform any data selection — so others might reuse or scrutinize it. Remember, data selection is a form of data processing.” Frolov 2021"

Enter username or email of the person you want to invite and change the role to ‘Owner’. Click ‘Invite’.)\n\n\n\nHave a maintainer of the project repository transfer it to the group namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Transfer Project).\n\n\n\nAfter doing this, the maintainer(s) of the project will get an email notifying that the project has been moved to a different location.\nNow the person who the project is being transferred to can move it to their own namespace (go to the project namespace, then from the sidebar, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Transfer Project like before).\nIf desired, the group can be deleted after the transfer is complete (go to the group namespace, then from the sidebar go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced &gt; Remove Group).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProviding a more straightforward way to transfer ownership in GitLab was raised as an issue in 2016, which is unfortunately still open."

(For example, if your data/code is part of a publication, you can name the upload ‘dataset/software underlying the publication’[title publication]’.\nAll the fields marked with a red * are required before you can publish your upload.\nSelect a license: Everything with CC in front of it is appropriate for data. The software licenses follow below (you may need to scroll).\nAdd any related references (GitHub/Lab repository, article DOI, other datasets).\nTake note of the DOI your dataset receives. You will need this DOI for your Data Availability Statement and your references.\n\nSelect keywords that your peers would use to find your type of research/data, or that you have discussed with department/section/project members to increase findability.\n\nUpload the data or code and the README file\nUnder files, select the ‘file deposit’ for data, and the ’software deposit for code. You can drop and select files or open up the file explorer by clicking on the upload area.\n\nYou can either upload directories separately or decide to use an archive file (open formats are: .zip .tar, .tgz, or tar.bz2 - See Jackson 2018b)\n\nYou can also use Python script to upload a folder which preserves the folder structure\n\nSubmit the upload for review\nWhen the upload is ready to be published, you can submit it for review by selecting the ‘SUBMIT FOR REVIEW’ button on the top of the upload:\n\nYou will get notified if you haven’t filled out all the required metadata fields. If all the fields are completed, you will see the message below and you will receive a confirmation email to the address associated with your account.\n\n\nYou may receive some feedback from 4TU.ResearchData to improve your submission.

    "text": "Open Science vs Patents\nOne of the primary limitations of patents is the inherent clash between the core principles of academia and open science and the commercialization of knowledge. Universities are built on the foundation of open sharing and collaboration, promoting the free exchange of ideas to advance human knowledge. Patents, on the other hand, create exclusive rights and monopolies, hindering the dissemination of knowledge (Boldrin and Levine 2009; Fabrizio 2007). This can impede scientific progress by restricting access to critical research findings. Additionally, the patenting process can be time-consuming and expensive (Stodden 2014), with little evidence to support the effectiveness of patents (Kenney and Patton 2009; Williams 2017). Moreover, the competitive nature of patents, and the perverse career pressures to produce more patents - Edwards and Roy 2017, may hinder collaboration among researchers.\nSome institutions, including the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and Aarhus University, have taken a bolder approach by adopting a ‘no patenting’ policy to permit the free re-use and distribution of their research. These policies recognise that for most universities acquiring patents and selling licences is loss-making and inhibits innovation.\nDylan Roskams-Edris writes the following in an article about Intellectual Property at the Neuro:"

Instead, a snapshot of the software should be shared using a data repository. This data repository will provide you with a persistent identifier, or DOI, which is key for making the code citable.\nSome data repositories, such as Zenodo and 4TU.ResearchData, have integrations with GitHub so that you can easily share a release of your software repositories.\nOnce you shared your software on a data repository and received a DOI, it is important to let others know how they should cite your data. If you’re reusing software of others, you should also properly cite their work."

If the version is unidentified or unknown, the date of access should be used.\n• Type: some citation styles (e.g., APA), require a bracketed description of the citation (e.g., [Computer software]) to be included.\nIf a published article exists that describes the software, it should be cited as an additional reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample (APA): Developer, A. A., Developer, B. B., & Developer, C. C. (yyyy) 1. Title of the software: Subtitle (Version #.#) 2. [Computer software] 3. Publisher 4. https://URL5\nSee Katz et al. 2020) for more examples."

    "text": "Some of the flaws of the peer review process include:\n\nBias: Reviewers may be biased against certain research or researchers (particularly when they have been nominated for review by the authors), which can affect their evaluations. For example, reviewers may be more likely to reject research that challenges their own views or that comes from researchers they do not know.There is also a bias in valuing positive results more than negative results.\nLack of diversity: Since identities of peer reviewers are often not known, it is difficult to assess their backgrounds, which can result in a lack of representation and potentially biased evaluations.\nLimited expertise: Reviewers may not have the necessary expertise to evaluate certain types of research, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate evaluations.\nSlow turnaround time: The peer review process can be slow, with some studies taking months or even years to be reviewed and published. This can delay the dissemination of important research findings. (See Preprints)\nLack of transparency: The peer review process is often not transparent, as peer reviewer identities are unknown and reviews are not always public. (see Open Peer Review)\nAgreement among reviewers is weak (Kravitz et al. 2010)\nRejections/acceptation decisions are inconsistent\nMajor errors and flaws are inconsistently discovered (Baxt et al. 1998, see Andersen 2013 for a case study)"
